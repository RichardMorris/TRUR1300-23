# TRUR1300-23
Code for the TRUR1300 Software Development Practices unit 2023-24

# Setting up VS-Code with git

From software centre install the VS Code and Git applications

Run VS Code

Set your username and email address

    git config user.name "Richard Morris"
    git config user.email "rich@singsurf.org"

This needs to be done on a per-project basis as we can't write the standard file on Truro computers.
At home you would use the `--global` option for both.


Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens 

Generate a Personal Access Token with the repo scope. These are like passwords but with finer grained access.

In the Source control tab hover over the file you want to change, and press +, this stages the file ready to be committed.

Add a brief description of the change in source control.

Press the Commit button, this updates the local git repository.
